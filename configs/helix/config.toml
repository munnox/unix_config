# At most one section each of 'keys.normal', 'keys.insert' and 'keys.select'
# [keys.normal]
C-s = ":w" # Maps the Control-s to the typable command :w which is an alias for :write (save file)

[keys.insert]
j = { j = "normal_mode" } # Maps `jk` to exit insert mode
"C-c" = "normal_mode" # Maps Ctrl=c to exiting insert mode like VIM
