# A git config file
# an example of its use is find the local .gitconfig file
# and add
# [include]
#     path = ~/unix_config/git/gitconfig
#
# This has worked on windows cmder out of the box an path
# variant seem to work ok on linux too. Windows just seem
# to be more picky aobut the path
# 
# A way of testing the config is
#
# $ git config --show-origin -l
#
# This only seems to use the main install config
# $ git config --system --show-origin -l
#
# This only seems to use the user config
# $ git config --global --show-origin -l
#
# This only seems to use the config in the current git repo
# $ git config --local --show-origin -l
