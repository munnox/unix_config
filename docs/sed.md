* You need a backslash before parens in a regex grouping
* You refer to matched regex groups using \1, \2, etc.
* The + regex operator does not work
* Non-greedy quantifiers donâ€™t work.  For example, .*? will not work
* The output is printed to standard out by default.  You need the -i option if you want to edit a file with sed.

Strip trailing whitespace from a file

`sed -i -e 's/ *$//'`

Remove the first line of a stream

`sed '1d'`

Recursively replace tabs with spaces

`grep -Plr '\t' src/ | xargs sed -i 's/\t/  /g'`
